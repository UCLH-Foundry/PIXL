# PIXL

PIXL Image eXtraction Laboratory

`PIXL` is a system for extracting, linking and de-identifying DICOM imaging data, structured EHR data and free-text data from radiology reports at UCLH.
Please see the [rolling-skeleton]([https://github.com/UCLH-Foundry/the-rolling-skeleton=](https://github.com/UCLH-Foundry/the-rolling-skeleton/blob/main/docs/design/100-day-design.md)) for more details.

PIXL is intended run on one of the [GAE](https://github.com/UCLH-Foundry/Book-of-FlowEHR/blob/main/glossary.md#gaes)s and comprises
several services orchestrated by [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

To get access to the GAE, [see the documentation on Slab](https://uclh.slab.com/posts/gae-access-7hkddxap)

## Services

## Setup

### 0. UCLH infrastructure setup

<details>
<summary>Install shared miniforge installation if it doesn't exist</summary>

Follow the suggestion for installing a central [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge)
installation to allow all users to be able to run modern python without having admin permissions.

```shell
# Create directory with correct structure (only if it doesn't exist yet)
mkdir /gae/miniforge3
chgrp -R docker /gae/miniforge3
chmod -R g+rwxs /gae/miniforge3  # inherit group when new directories or files are created
setfacl -R -m d:g::rwX /gae/miniforge3
# Install miniforge
wget "https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh"
bash Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh -p /gae/miniforge3
conda update -n base -c conda-forge conda
conda create -n pixl_dev python=3.10.*
```

The directory should now have these permissions

```shell
> ls -lah /gae/miniforge3/
total 88K
drwxrws---+  19 jstein01 docker 4.0K Nov 28 12:27 .
drwxrwx---.  18 root     docker 4.0K Dec  1 19:35 ..
drwxrws---+   2 jstein01 docker 8.0K Nov 28 12:27 bin
drwxrws---+   2 jstein01 docker   30 Nov 28 11:49 compiler_compat
drwxrws---+   2 jstein01 docker   32 Nov 28 11:49 condabin
drwxrws---+   2 jstein01 docker 8.0K Nov 28 12:27 conda-meta
-rw-rws---.   1 jstein01 docker   24 Nov 28 11:49 .condarc
...
```

</details>
<details>

<summary>If you haven't just installed the miniforge yourself, update your configuration</summary>

Edit `~/.bash_profile` to add `/gae/miniforge3/bin` to the PATH. for example

```shell
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/bin:/gae/miniforge3/bin
```

Run the updated profile (or reconnect to the GAE) so that conda is in your PATH

```shell
source ~/.bash_profile
```

Initialise conda

```shell
conda init bash
```

Run the updated profile (or reconnect to the GAE) so that conda is in your PATH

```shell
source ~/.bash_profile
```

Activate an existing pixl environment

```shell
conda activate pixl_dev
```

</details>
<details>
<summary>Create an instance for the GAE if it doesn't already exist</summary>

Select a place for the deployment. On UCLH infrastructure this will be in `/gae`, so `/gae/pixl_dev` for example.

```shell
mkdir /gae/pixl_dev
chgrp -R docker /gae/pixl_dev
chmod -R g+rwxs /gae/pixl_dev  # inherit group when new directories or files are created
setfacl -R -m d:g::rwX /gae/pixl_dev
# now clone the repository or copy an existing deployment
```

</details>

### 1. Choose deployment environment

This is one of `dev|test|staging|prod` and referred to as `<environment>` in the docs.

### 2. Initialise environment configuration

Create a local `.env` file in the _PIXL_ directory:

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```

Add the missing configuration values to the new files:

#### Environment

Set `ENV` to `<environment>`.

#### Credentials

- `EMAP_DB_`*
UDS credentials are only required for `prod` or `staging` deployments of when working on the EHR & report retriever component.
You can leave them blank for other dev work.
- `PIXL_DB_`*
These are credentials for the containerised PostgreSQL service and are set in the official PostgreSQL image.
Use a strong password for `prod` deployment but the only requirement for other environments is consistency as several services interact with the database.
- `PIXL_EHR_API_AZ_`*
These credentials are used for uploading a PIXL database to Azure blob storage. They should be for a service principal that has `Storage Blob Data Contributor`
on the target storage account. The storage account must also allow network access from the PIXL host machine.

#### Ports

Most services need to expose ports that must be mapped to ports on the host. The host port is specified in `.env`
Ports need to be configured such that they don't clash with any other application running on that GAE.

#### Storage size

The maximum storage size of the `orthanc-raw` instance can be configured through the
`ORTHANC_RAW_MAXIMUM_STORAGE_SIZE` environment variable in `.env`. This limits the storage size to
the specified value (in MB). When the storage is full [Orthanc will automatically recycle older
studies in favour of new ones](https://orthanc.uclouvain.be/book/faq/features.html#id8).

#### CogStack URL

For the deidentification of the EHR extracts, we rely on an instance running the
[CogStack API](https://cogstack.org/) with a `/redact` endpoint. The URL of this instance should be
set in `.env` as `COGSTACK_REDACT_URL`.

### 3. Configure a new project

To configure a new project, follow these steps:

1. Create a new `git` branch from `main`

    ```sh
    git checkout main
    git pull
    git switch -c <branch-name>
    ```

1. Copy the `template_config.yaml` file to a new file in the `projects/config` directory and fill
   in the details.
1. The filename of the project config should be `<project-slug>`.yaml

    >[!NOTE]
    > The project slug should match the [slugify](https://github.com/un33k/python-slugify)-ed project name in the `extract_summary.json` log file!

2. [Open a PR in PIXL](https://github.com/UCLH-Foundry/PIXL/compare) to merge the new project config into `main`

#### The config YAML file

The configuration file defines:

- Project name: the `<project-slug>` name of the Project
- The DICOM dataset modalities to retain (e.g. `["DX", "CR"]` for X-Ray studies)
- The [anonymisation operations](/pixl_dcmd/README.md#tag-scheme-anonymisation) to be applied to the DICOM tags,
  by providing a file path to one or multiple YAML files.
  We currently allow two types of files:
    - `base`: the base set of DICOM tags to be retained in the anonymised dataset
    - `manufacturer_overrides`: any manufacturer-specific overrides to the base set of DICOM tags. This is useful for
        manufacturers that store sensitive information in non-standard DICOM tags. Multiple manufacturers
        can be specified in the YAML file as follows:

    ```yaml
    - manufacturer: "Philips"
      tags:
      - group: 0x2001
        element: 0x1003
        op: "keep"
        # ...
    - manufacturer: "Siemens"
      tags:
      - group: 0x0019
        element: 0x100c
        op: "keep"
        # ...
    ```

- The endpoints used to upload the anonymised DICOM data and the public and radiology
  [parquet files](./docs/file_types/parquet_files.md). We currently support the following endpoints:
    - `"none"`: no upload
    - `"ftps"`: a secure FTP server (for both _DICOM_ and _parquet_ files)
    <!-- - `"azure"`: a secure Azure Dicom web service (for both _DICOM_ and _parquet_ files) -->
    <!--   Requires the `AZURE_*` environment variables to be set in `.env` -->
    <!-- - `"dicomweb"`: a DICOMweb server (for _DICOM_ files only) -->
    <!--   Requires the `DICOMWEB_*` environment variables to be set in `.env` -->

#### Project secrets

Any credentials required for uploading the project's results should be stored in an **Azure Key Vault**
(set up instructions below).
PIXL will query this key vault for the required secrets at runtime. This requires the following
environment variables to be set in `.secrets.env` so that PIXL can connect to the key vault:

- `EXPORT_AZ_CLIENT_ID`: the service principal's client ID, mapped to `AZURE_CLIENT ID` in `docker-compose`
- `EXPORT_AZ_CLIENT_PASSWORD`: the password, mapped to `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` in `docker-compose`
- `EXPORT_AZ_TENANT_ID`: ID of the service principal's tenant. Also called its 'directory' ID. Mapped to `AZURE_TENANT_ID` in `docker-compose`
- `EXPORT_AZ_KEY_VAULT_NAME` the name of the key vault, used to connect to the correct key vault

Create the `.secrets.env` file in the _PIXL_ directory by copying the sample:

```bash
cp .secrets.env.sample .secrets.env
```

and fill in the missing values (for dev purposes find the `pixl-dev-secrets.env` note on LastPass).

<details><summary>Azure Keyvault setup</summary>

## Azure Keyvault setup

_This is done for the \_UCLH_DIF_ `dev` tenancy, will need to be done once in the _UCLHAZ_ `prod`
tenancy when ready to deploy to production.\_

This Key Vault and secret must persist any infrastructure changes so should be separate from disposable
infrastructure services. ServicePrincipal is required to connect to the Key Vault.

The application uses the ServicePrincipal and password to authenticate with Azure via environment
variables. See [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azure-identity/azure.identity.environmentcredential?view=azure-python)
for more info.

The Key Vault and ServicePrincipal have already been created for the `dev` environment and details
are stored in the `pixl-dev-secrets.env` note in the shared PIXL folder on _LastPass_.

The process for doing so using the `az` CLI tool is described below.
This process must be repeated for `staging` & `prod` environments.

### Step 1

Create the Azure Key Vault in an appropriate resource group:

```bash
az keyvault create --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <key-vault-name> --location "UKSouth"
```

### Step 2

Create Service Principal & grant access as per

```bash
az ad sp create-for-rbac -n pixl-secrets --skip-assignment
```

This will produce the following output

```json
{
    "appId": "<generated-app-ID>",
    "displayName": "<app-name>",
    "name": "http://<app-name>",
    "password": "<generated-password>",
    "tenant": "<tenant-ID>"
}
```

### Step 3

Assign correct permissions to the newly created ServicePrincipal

```bash
az keyvault set-policy --name <key-vault-name> --spn <generated-app-ID> --secret-permissions backup delete get list set
```

### Step 4

Create a secret and store in the Key Vault

Use Python to create a secret:

```python
import secrets
secrets.token_urlsafe(32)
```

copy the secret and paste as <secret-value> below

```bash
az keyvault secret set --vault-name "<key-vault-name>" --name "<secret-name>" --value "<secret-value>"
```

### Step 5

Save credentials in `.secrets.env` and a LastPass `PIXL Keyvault <project-slug> secrets` note.

```
EXPORT_AZ_CLIENT_ID=<generated-app-ID>
EXPORT_AZ_CLIENT_PASSWORD=<generated-password>
EXPORT_AZ_TENANT_ID=<tenant-ID>
EXPORT_AZ_KEY_VAULT_NAME=<key-vault-name>
```
</details>

## Run

### Start

From the _PIXL_ directory:

```bash
bin/pixldc pixl_dev up
```

### Stop

From the _PIXL_ directory:

```bash
bin/pixldc pixl_dev down
```

## Analysis

The number of DICOM instances in the raw Orthanc instance can be accessed from
`http://<pixl_host>:<ORTHANC_RAW_WEB_PORT>/ui/app/#/settings` and similarly with
the Orthanc Anon instance, where `pixl_host` is the host of the PIXL services
and `ORTHANC_RAW_WEB_PORT` is defined in `.env`.

The number of reports and EHR can be interrogated by connecting to the PIXL
database with a database client (e.g. [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/)), using
the connection parameters defined in `.env`. For example, to find the number of
non-null reports

```sql
select count(*) from emap_data.ehr_anon where xray_report is not null;
```

## Develop

See each service's README for instructions for individual developing and testing instructions.
Most modules require [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) and `docker-compose` to be installed to run tests.

For Python development we use [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) alongside [pytest](https://www.pytest.org/).
There is support (sometimes through plugins) for these tools in most IDEs & editors.

Before raising a PR, make sure to **run all tests** for each PIXL module
and not just the component you have been working on as this will help us catch unintentional regressions without spending GH actions minutes :-)

We run [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) as part of the GitHub Actions CI. To install and run it locally, do:

```sh
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

The configuration can be found in [`.pre-commit-config.yml`](./.pre-commit-config.yaml)

## Assumptions

PIXL data extracts include the below assumptions

- (MRN, Accession number) is unique identifier for a report/DICOM study pair
- Patients have a single _relevant_ MRN

## File journey overview

Files that are present at each step of the pipeline.

A more detailed description of the relevant file types is available in [`docs/file_types/parquet_files.md`](./docs/file_types/parquet_files.md).
